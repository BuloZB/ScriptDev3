SD3 (Script Dev3)
---

Is a optional c++ scripting library module for MaNGOS.

It is based on the old SD2 scripting library, enhanced and made into a internal library rather than an external DLL. 

Rather than having multiple libraries for each core, this library uses the advantages of the new syncronised MaNGOS cores to use a single scripting library which will support all the cores.
 
Scripting done properly !
